## What was learned 
With this application, I learned to create a REST API on the server using Cors and Express. Additionally I learned to organize my code with a class constructor; which reduced time inputting new character data. More importantly, this application pushed me to practice using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to ensure proper routing. I also integrated a request method to render my static files. Lastly, I remembered how much fun it was growing up watching Powerpuff girls as a child.
