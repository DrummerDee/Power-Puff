      <p tabindex="4">I remember being a child and watching Power Puff girls on Cartoon Network, I was mesmorized by all of the characters. Back then, I wasn't able to Google, I wasn't old enough, the characters to learn everything I wanted about them. So I decided, many years later, to give that to all of my Powerpuff Girls lovers the same ability, with a simple word search. </p>
